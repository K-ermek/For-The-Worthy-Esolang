# For-The-Worthy-Esolang
C++ Interpreter for the For The Worthy esolang. Some code examples. 

With the For The Worthy language you can finally realize your dream of becoming a true programmer thus using only the necessary things in life, the '1' and '0' keys.
The language only interprets the '0' and '1' from any text file. Also if a line starts with '#' all characters in it will be ignored, even the '0' and '1'.
It works by interpreting the first 4 bits as a function, then based on what that function is expects more bits. When is runs out of bits to expect, 
the next 4 are interepreted as a function again.
